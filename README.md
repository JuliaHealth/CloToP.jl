# Clozapine Toxicity Predictor

[![DOI](images/zenodo.11048224.png)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11048224)

This [Julia](https://julialang.org/) toolbox allows predicting [clozapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clozapine) (CLO) and [norclozapine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmethylclozapine) (NCLO) blood concentrations.

Individual recommended safe dose range can also be predicted:

## Performance

The model are actively developed and we expect its accuracy to improve.

In the figure above, patients are sorted by increasing CLO or NCLO measured level.

Adjusted clozapine level is the classifier prediction modified by predicted norclozapine concentration.

Toxic clozapine level has been defined as > 550 ng/mL, recommended therapeutic concentration has been defined as > 250 ng/mL [source: [10.1192/bjp.2023.27](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2023.27)].

## Quickstart

Install the latest Julia version from [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)

Clone this repository, go to its folder and run to install required packages (this has to be done only once):

```sh
julia src/install.jl
```

Start the server:

```sh
julia src/install.jl
```

The server is listening on port 8080. With your web browser, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), enter patient's data and click the "PREDICT" button.
